Track Suggester

A website to help select your education path.

By David Mortkowitz

Description
This website was created with the intent to help a student, who might otherwise not already know which educational path they’d like to take, decide which is right for them. Please note: The choices have little to nothing to do with the results, and this should be viewed as a low-level exercise in coding. Thank you!
